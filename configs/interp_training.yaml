# Discriminator
disc_channels: 64        # Base discriminator channels

# Training
epochs: 30               # Reduced from 100 (most learning in early epochs)
batch_size: 12           # Maximum for 5070 Ti 16GB VRAM (~14GB usage estimated)
num_workers: 12          # High parallelism for fast data loading
crop_size: [256, 256]    # Random crop size for training
prefetch_factor: 4       # Prefetch batches per worker
persistent_workers: true # Keep workers alive between epochs
max_samples: 100000      # Limit dataset size for faster training (~3.5 days)
